    Entitlement checks sit on the request path: a service asks Space "may this
    user do this?" before serving a request. Done synchronously inside an event
    loop, that call blocks every other request the process is serving for as long
    as it takes - including the full timeout, when Space is slow or unreachable.

    Same modules, same method names, same arguments and same exceptions as
    :class:`~space_client.space_client.SpaceClient`; the calls are awaited. The
    logic behind them is shared rather than copied, so the two cannot drift.

    Unlike the synchronous client, this one does not open its WebSocket in the
    constructor, because a constructor cannot await. Call :meth:`connect`, or use
    the client as an async context manager, if you want pricing events; HTTP
    calls work either way.
