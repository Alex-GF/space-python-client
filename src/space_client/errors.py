"""Errors the client raises when Space refuses or cannot be reached.

Every HTTP call used to answer ``None`` for three different situations: the
server refused the request, the server could not be reached, and the server
answered with nothing. A caller holding a ``None`` could not tell which had
happened, so the only two options were to treat every failure as absence or to
guess.

That matters most for the calls that change something. ``add_contract``
returning ``None`` looks exactly the same whether a contract was created and
the body was empty or whether Space answered ``400 Plan FREE for service X not
found in the request organization`` - and in the second case an application
carries on believing its user is subscribed.

These are deliberately narrow: ``SpaceApiError`` carries what the server said,
``SpaceConnectionError`` says it was never reached, and both derive from
``SpaceError`` so a caller who does not care about the difference can catch one
thing.
